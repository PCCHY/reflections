When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i have to make my project public
when i work with many peoples who develop program individually
as a backup if computer looses data
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
by manual pull we have better knowledge about our project and better control over it.
we prefer to work on remote repository which gives us interactive interface so we pull changes to git when necessary so no memory is waste on local computers.
