When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i have to make my project public
when i work with many peoples who develop program individually
as a backup if computer looses data
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
by manual pull we have better knowledge about our project and better control over it.
we prefer to work on remote repository which gives us interactive interface so we pull changes to git when necessary so no memory is waste on local computers.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are copy of main repository in github so that we can work on files without affecting main repository.these are used when we need perform work somebody else repository.
clones is similar to forks by this we can download repository on local machines to perform work on it.these are required when we need to change files locally.
branches are same version of files with different features.thse are need when we need to create same file with different features.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
we have record of github repository
it helps us in merging
it helps in fast forward merges.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
we can collaborate by exchanging data in pd or google docs
but in this method we dont have good record of history
we cant keep record of file 
it is harder to maintain more than 3 collaborators
